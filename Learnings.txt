1: Nullable for setting null and required is for set the value to validate success...

[Required]
public DateTime? OrderDate { get; set; }

Nullable: makes sure, that we do not see "0" for integer and some "dafault" date when the entry form is loaded.
And [Required] make sure, that value is always entered from the user.
Then model validate will be performed efficiently without any defaults....

The Model validation considering the data coming from client to server then only we will interact with DB.
Bind[attributes] User user : Validates only specified attributes in that model
User user : Validates all attributes in that model
